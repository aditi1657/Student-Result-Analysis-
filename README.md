# Student-Result-Analysis-
Student Result Analysis using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Data Visualization
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using "Python and Data Analysis techniques".  
The objective is to explore student score data, identify performance trends, and visualize insights using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

This project helped strengthen my understanding of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, making it suitable as a beginner-level data analytics project.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook 

## Dataset
The dataset contains student-related academic information such as:
- Student scores
- Subject-wise marks
- Overall performance indicators

(Dataset used for educational and learning purposes.)

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data loading and inspection
- Statistical analysis of student scores
- Subject-wise performance comparison
- Identification of high and low performing students
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of results using graphs and charts

##  Visualizations Included
- Score distribution plots
- Subject-wise comparison charts
- Performance trend visualizations
- Graphical insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

##  Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with Pandas and NumPy
- Understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Structuring a real-world data analytics project
